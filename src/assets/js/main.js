    All scripts should be included or imported via this file.
    This is made available to achieve effects that are not possible with the current HTML/CSS. (ie. click actions, mouse tracking, etc.)
    DO NOT use javascript to apply class, ids, or any other type of selector to make it easier on you to select via CSS.
    
    If you are unsure if your javascript is accectable please confirm with your professor. Better to ask first, than loose points later.
